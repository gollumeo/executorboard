# ExecutorBoard

ExecutorBoard is a private, structured workspace that maintains order and clarity in estate communication. It exists to provide a stable reference when communication is under pressure, without replacing legal counsel or making decisions.

## Who it serves
- Executors responsible for keeping heirs informed.
- Attorneys and estate professionals who need consistent, controlled communication with clients.

## What it provides
- A single reference point for updates, documents, and decisions.
- Explicit access control: invite the right people, revoke when needed.
- A structured record of progress and next steps.
- Communication that stays deliberate, not reactive.

## What it is not
- Not legal advice or a substitute for counsel.
- Not an automated decision system.
- Not a mass messaging tool.

## How it is used (high level)
- Create an estate workspace.
- Invite participants to view updates.
- Publish structured updates as administration progresses.
- Close the workspace when the estate is complete.

## Status
ExecutorBoard is in private beta. The landing site exists and the backend foundation is in progress; public API endpoints and production hardening are not yet complete.

## For contributors
Developer-oriented repository and setup notes live in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`.
