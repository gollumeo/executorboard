# ExecutorBoard

A private, structured “executor board” for keeping estate communication clear, consistent, and calm.

When an estate is in progress, families and professionals need updates—but email threads, scattered documents, and informal messages quickly turn into confusion, delays, and unnecessary conflict. ExecutorBoard is designed to give the executor a single place to share meaningful updates, manage access, and keep everyone aligned.

## Who it’s for
- Executors who want a simple way to keep heirs informed.
- Attorneys and firms who want clearer, safer client communication.
- Families who want fewer surprises and a clearer picture of progress.

## What it helps you achieve
- Reduce back-and-forth by centralizing updates in one place.
- Keep access intentional: invite the right people, revoke when needed.
- Maintain a clear timeline of what happened and what’s next.
- Share progress without oversharing—communication stays structured and purposeful.

## How it works (high level)
- Create an estate board.
- Invite participants (heirs, co-executors, attorneys) to view updates.
- Post structured updates as the administration progresses.
- Close the board when the estate is complete.

## Project status
ExecutorBoard is under active development. The landing site exists and the backend foundation is in place, but public API endpoints and production hardening are still in progress.

## For contributors
